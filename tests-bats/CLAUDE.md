# CLAUDE.md - BATS Test System Guide for AI Assistants

This file provides guidance for AI assistants (like Claude Code) when working with the BATS test system in this directory.

## Critical Architecture Understanding

### The Sequential State Building Pattern

The most important concept to understand is how sequential tests build state:

```
00-validate-tests → sequential env, no repo work
01-clone         → sequential env, creates TEST_REPO
02-setup         → sequential env, runs setup.sh in TEST_REPO
03-meta          → sequential env, validates META.json generation
04-dist          → sequential env, creates distribution zip
05-setup-final   → sequential env, final validation
```

Each test **assumes** the previous test's work is complete. Test 03 expects TEST_REPO to exist with a configured Makefile. If the environment is clean, those assumptions break.

### The Pollution Detection Contract

**Key insight**: Sequential tests share state, so we must detect when that state is invalid.

State becomes invalid when:
1. **Incomplete execution**: Test started but crashed (`.start-*` exists but no `.complete-*`)
2. **Out-of-order execution**: Running tests 01-03 after a previous run that completed 01-05 leaves state from tests 04-05

When pollution is detected, `setup_sequential_test()` rebuilds the world:
1. Clean environment completely
2. Re-run all prerequisite tests
3. Start fresh

**Why this matters to you**: If you break pollution detection, tests will fail mysteriously because they're using stale/wrong state.

### The Special Case of 00-validate-tests.bats

This test validates that all other tests follow required structure. It's a meta-test.

**Critical rule**: It MUST follow sequential test rules even though it doesn't use the test environment.

**Why**: Its filename matches `[0-9][0-9]-*.bats`, so:
- `detect_dirty_state()` includes it in test ordering logic
- If it doesn't have state markers, pollution detection breaks
- Other tests may try to check if it completed

**The pattern**: ANY test matching `[0-9][0-9]-*.bats` must follow sequential rules, period. Filename determines behavior.

### BATS vs Legacy Test Infrastructure

**CRITICAL**: BATS tests DO NOT use lib.sh from the legacy test system.

The legacy test system (tests/* scripts) uses lib.sh which provides:
- Output functions that use file descriptors 8 & 9
- Redirection functions for capturing test output
- These are designed for capturing entire test output to log files

**BATS tests have their own infrastructure** in tests-bats/helpers.bash:
- Output functions that use file descriptor 3 (BATS requirement)
- Variable setup functions (setup_pgxntool_vars) extracted from lib.sh
- No file descriptor redirection (BATS handles this internally)

**Why the separation?**
- lib.sh's output functions use FD 8/9 which don't exist in BATS context
- BATS has its own output capturing mechanism (uses FD 1/2/3)
- Mixing the two systems causes "Bad file descriptor" errors

**What BATS tests DO use:**
- TOPDIR, TEST_DIR, TEST_REPO, RESULT_DIR (from .env file)
- PGXNREPO, PGXNBRANCH, TEST_TEMPLATE, PG_LOCATION (from setup_pgxntool_vars)
- Helper functions in helpers.bash (out, error, debug, assertion functions)

**What BATS tests DO NOT use:**
- lib.sh's redirect() / reset_redirect() functions
- lib.sh's out() / error() functions (incompatible FD usage)
- Legacy test output capturing mechanism

### BATS Output Handling: File Descriptors

**CRITICAL**: BATS has special requirements for output that you MUST follow or tests will fail silently or hang.

BATS maintains strict separation between test output and the TAP (Test Anything Protocol) stream:

**File Descriptor 1 (stdout) & File Descriptor 2 (stderr)**:
- Output to these is **captured** and only shown when tests **fail**
- Used for diagnostic information that shouldn't clutter successful runs
- Example: command output, error messages from failures

**File Descriptor 3 (&3)**:
- Output to FD 3 goes **directly to the terminal**, shown unconditionally
- Used for debug messages, progress indicators, status updates
- **This is what our `debug()` function uses**: `echo "DEBUG[$level]: $message" >&3`

**Critical Rules**:

1. **Never use `>&2` for debug output in BATS** - it gets captured and won't show up
2. **Always use `>&3` for debug/status messages** you want to see while tests run
3. **Close FD 3 for long-running child processes**: `command 3>&-` to prevent BATS from hanging
4. **Prefix FD 3 output with `#`** for TAP compliance: `echo '# message' >&3`

**Example**:
```bash
# WRONG - won't show up during test run
debug() {
  echo "DEBUG: $*" >&2  # Captured, only shown on failure
}

# CORRECT - shows immediately
debug() {
  echo "DEBUG: $*" >&3  # Goes directly to terminal
}
```

**Reference**: https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writing-tests.html#printing-to-the-terminal

### Output Helper Functions

We provide three helper functions for all output in BATS tests. **Always use these instead of raw echo commands:**

#### `out "message"`
**Purpose**: Output informational messages that should always be visible

**Usage**:
```bash
out "Creating test environment..."
out "Running prerequisites..."
out "Test completed successfully"
```

**Implementation**: Automatically prefixes with `#` and sends to FD 3

#### `error "message"`
**Purpose**: Output error message and return failure (return 1)

**Usage**:
```bash
if [ ! -f "$required_file" ]; then
  error "Required file not found: $required_file"
fi

# Equivalent to:
# out "ERROR: Required file not found: $required_file"
# return 1
```

**When to use**: Any error condition that should fail the test/function

#### `debug LEVEL "message"`
**Purpose**: Conditional debug output based on DEBUG environment variable

**Usage**:
```bash
debug 1 "POLLUTION DETECTED: test incomplete"  # Most important
debug 2 "Checking prerequisites..."             # Workflow
debug 3 "Found marker file: .start-test"        # Detail
debug 5 "Full state: $state_contents"           # Verbose
```

**Debug Levels**:
- **1**: Critical errors, pollution detection (always want to see when debugging)
- **2**: Test flow, major operations (setup, prerequisites)
- **3**: Detailed state checking, file operations
- **4**: Reserved for future use
- **5**: Maximum verbosity, full traces

**Enable with**: `DEBUG=2 test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/01-clone.bats`

**Critical Rules**:
1. **Never use `echo` directly** - always use `out()`, `error()`, or `debug()`
   - `echo` to stdout/stderr gets captured by BATS and only shows on failure
   - Direct `echo` without `#` prefix breaks TAP output format
   - Violations make debugging much harder
   - **ALWAYS** use the output helper functions
2. **Never output to >&2** - it gets captured by BATS and won't show
3. **All output must go through these helpers** to ensure visibility

**Bad Example:**
```bash
echo "Starting test..."  # Won't appear when you need it!
cd "$TEST_REPO" || echo "cd failed"  # Error hidden until test fails
```

**Good Example:**
```bash
out "Starting test..."  # Always visible
cd "$TEST_REPO" || error "Failed to cd to TEST_REPO"  # Error visible immediately
```

## Shell Error Handling Rules

### Never Use `|| true` Without Clear Documentation

**CRITICAL RULE:** Never use `|| true` to suppress errors without a clear, documented reason in a comment.

**Why This Matters:**
- `|| true` silently masks failures, making debugging nearly impossible
- Real bugs get hidden behind "it's supposed to fail sometimes"
- Future maintainers won't know if the suppression is intentional or a bug

**Bad Examples:**
```bash
cd "$TEST_REPO" 2>/dev/null || true  # Why is this OK to fail?

git status || true  # Is this hiding a real problem?

rm -f somefile || true  # rm -f already doesn't fail on missing files!
```

**Good Examples (if suppression is truly needed):**
```bash
# OK to fail: TEST_REPO may not exist in early setup tests before test 2
cd "$TEST_REPO" 2>/dev/null || true

# OK to fail: This test intentionally checks error handling
run some_command_that_should_fail || true
```

**Better Alternatives:**
```bash
# Instead of suppressing, let it fail if it should fail:
cd "$TEST_REPO"  # Should exist at this point; fail if it doesn't

# Use BATS skip if operation is conditional:
if [ ! -d "$TEST_REPO" ]; then
  skip "TEST_REPO not created yet"
fi
cd "$TEST_REPO"

# For truly optional operations, be explicit:
if [ -f "optional_file" ]; then
  process_optional_file
fi
# Don't use: process_optional_file 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Review Checklist for `|| true`:**
1. Is there a comment explaining why failure is acceptable?
2. Could this hide a real bug?
3. Would using `skip` be clearer?
4. Is the operation truly optional, or should it be required?

## Common Mistakes When Modifying Tests

### Mistake 1: Not Following Sequential Rules

**Bad**:
```bash
# File: 06-new-feature.bats
load helpers

@test "test something" {
  # Missing setup_file, setup, teardown_file
  assert_file_exists "$TEST_REPO/something"
}
```

**Why bad**: Filename `06-*.bats` matches sequential pattern, but doesn't:
- Call `setup_sequential_test()` in `setup_file()`
- Call `load_test_env()` in `setup()`
- Call `mark_test_complete()` in `teardown_file()`

Result: Breaks pollution detection, other tests fail mysteriously.

**Good**:
```bash
# File: 06-new-feature.bats
load helpers

setup_file() {
  setup_sequential_test "06-new-feature" "05-setup-final"
}

setup() {
  load_test_env "sequential"
}

teardown_file() {
  mark_test_complete "06-new-feature"
}

@test "test something" {
  assert_file_exists "$TEST_REPO/something"
}
```

### Mistake 2: Wrong Environment Name

**Bad**:
```bash
setup_file() {
  setup_sequential_test "02-setup" "01-clone"
}

setup() {
  load_test_env "setup"  # Wrong! Creates separate environment
}
```

**Why bad**: Sequential tests MUST use `"sequential"` environment. Using different name creates separate environment, breaks shared state.

**Good**:
```bash
setup() {
  load_test_env "sequential"  # Correct
}
```

### Mistake 3: Forgetting to Mark Complete

**Bad**:
```bash
setup_file() {
  setup_sequential_test "03-meta" "02-setup"
}

setup() {
  load_test_env "sequential"
}

# Missing teardown_file
```

**Why bad**: No `mark_test_complete()` call means:
- Next test sees incomplete state
- Triggers pollution detection
- Causes full environment rebuild

**Good**:
```bash
teardown_file() {
  mark_test_complete "03-meta"  # Always add this
}
```

### Mistake 4: Wrong Prerequisites

**Bad**:
```bash
setup_file() {
  # Test 04 depends on 03, but doesn't list it
  setup_sequential_test "04-dist" "01-clone"
}
```

**Why bad**: If environment is polluted and rebuilt, prerequisites are re-run. But this only re-runs 01-clone, not 02-setup or 03-meta. Test fails because META.json doesn't exist.

**Good**:
```bash
setup_file() {
  # List immediate prerequisite (system will check it recursively)
  setup_sequential_test "04-dist" "03-meta"
}
```

Or if you want to be explicit about the full chain:
```bash
setup_file() {
  setup_sequential_test "04-dist" "01-clone" "02-setup" "03-meta"
}
```

### Mistake 5: Modifying helpers.bash Without Understanding Impact

**Example**: Changing `detect_dirty_state()` logic.

**Why dangerous**: This function is called by every sequential test. A bug breaks the entire test suite in subtle ways.

**Before modifying**:
1. Read the function completely
2. Understand what "pollution" means
3. Test with multiple scenarios:
   - Clean run of full suite
   - Run tests 01-03, then re-run 01-03
   - Run tests 01-05, then run only 01-03
   - Run test that crashes mid-execution
4. Verify pollution is detected correctly in all cases

## Safe Modification Patterns

### Adding a New Sequential Test

**Steps**:
1. **Choose number**: Next in sequence (e.g., if 05 exists, use 06)
2. **Create file**: `0X-descriptive-name.bats`
3. **Copy template** from existing test (e.g., 03-meta.bats)
4. **Update setup_file**:
   - Change test name
   - List immediate prerequisite
5. **Write tests**: Use semantic assertions
6. **Test individually**: `test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/0X-name.bats`
7. **Test in sequence**: Run full suite

**Template**:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bats

load helpers

setup_file() {
  setup_sequential_test "0X-name" "0Y-previous"
}

setup() {
  load_test_env "sequential"
}

teardown_file() {
  mark_test_complete "0X-name"
}

@test "descriptive test name" {
  # Your test code
  assert_something
}
```

### Adding a New Independent Test

**Steps**:
1. **Choose name**: `test-feature-name.bats` (NOT numbered)
2. **Choose environment**: Unique name (e.g., `"feature-name"`)
3. **List prerequisites**: Which sequential tests to run first
4. **Write tests**: No teardown_file needed

**Template**:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bats

load helpers

setup_file() {
  # Run prerequisites: clone → setup → meta
  setup_independent_test "test-feature" "feature" "01-clone" "02-setup" "03-meta"
}

setup() {
  load_test_env "feature"
}

# No teardown_file needed for independent tests

@test "test feature" {
  # Test runs in complete isolation
  assert_something
}
```

### Modifying Existing Tests

**Safe**:
- Adding new `@test` blocks
- Changing assertion details
- Adding comments

**Risky**:
- Changing test name (passed to `setup_sequential_test`)
- Changing prerequisites
- Removing `teardown_file()`
- Changing environment name

**Before modifying**:
1. Run test individually to verify it passes
2. Run full suite to verify prerequisites work
3. Clean environment and re-run to verify pollution detection works

### Modifying helpers.bash

**Critical functions** (test thoroughly before changing):
- `detect_dirty_state()` - Pollution detection logic
- `setup_sequential_test()` - Sequential test initialization
- `mark_test_start()` - State marker creation
- `mark_test_complete()` - State marker completion

**Less critical** (safer to modify):
- `assert_*` functions - Just add tests for new assertions
- `debug()` - Output function, low risk

**Testing strategy**:
1. Make change
2. Run full suite (01-05): Should pass quickly, no rebuilds
3. Clean and re-run: Should pass, building fresh state
4. Run 01-03, then re-run 01-03: Should pass, reusing state
5. Run 01-05, then run only 01-03: Should detect pollution and rebuild

## Debugging Strategies

### Test Fails: "Environment polluted"

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check state markers
ls -la .envs/sequential/.bats-state/

# Look for incomplete tests
for f in .envs/sequential/.bats-state/.start-*; do
  test=$(basename "$f" | sed 's/^.start-//')
  if [ ! -f ".envs/sequential/.bats-state/.complete-$test" ]; then
    echo "Incomplete: $test"
  fi
done
```

**Common causes**:
1. Test crashed and left incomplete state
2. Running tests out of order
3. Test doesn't call `mark_test_complete()`

**Fix**:
```bash
# Clean and try again
rm -rf .envs/
test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/01-clone.bats
```

### Test Fails: "TEST_REPO not found"

**Diagnosis**: Prerequisites didn't run.

**Causes**:
1. Test doesn't declare prerequisites in `setup_file()`
2. Prerequisite test failed
3. Wrong environment name (created separate environment)

**Fix**:
1. Check `setup_file()` declares prerequisites
2. Check environment name is `"sequential"`
3. Run prerequisites manually to see if they pass

### Test Passes Individually, Fails in Suite

**Diagnosis**: Test depends on previous test but doesn't declare it.

**Example**:
```bash
# This passes (auto-runs prerequisites):
test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/04-dist.bats

# But when run after 03-meta fails, 04 also fails
# because it assumed 03 completed
```

**Fix**: Add missing prerequisite to `setup_sequential_test()`.

### Pollution Detection Too Aggressive

**Symptom**: Every test triggers full rebuild even when state is clean.

**Diagnosis**: Bug in `detect_dirty_state()` logic.

**Common causes**:
1. Test ordering logic is wrong (check `ls [0-9][0-9]-*.bats | sort`)
2. Incomplete test detection is wrong (check `.start-*` vs `.complete-*` logic)
3. Test name doesn't match expected pattern

**Debug**:
```bash
# Add debug output
DEBUG=5 test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/02-setup.bats

# Check what detect_dirty_state sees
cd .envs/sequential/.bats-state
ls -la
```

## Key Invariants to Maintain

When modifying the test system, these must remain true:

### Invariant 1: Sequential Test Contract
```
IF filename matches [0-9][0-9]-*.bats
THEN test MUST:
  - Call setup_sequential_test() in setup_file()
  - Call load_test_env("sequential") in setup()
  - Call mark_test_complete() in teardown_file()
```

### Invariant 2: Pollution Detection Correctness
```
detect_dirty_state(test) returns 1 (dirty) IFF:
  - Some test started but didn't complete (crashed)
  - OR some test that runs AFTER current test has already run
```

### Invariant 3: State Marker Consistency
```
For each sequential test:
  - .start-X exists → test has started
  - .complete-X exists → test finished successfully
  - .pid-X exists → test is currently running
  - If .start-X but not .complete-X → test is incomplete (crashed or running)
```

### Invariant 4: Environment Isolation
```
- Sequential tests MUST use "sequential" environment (shared state)
- Independent tests MUST use unique environment names (isolated state)
- Different environments NEVER share state
```

### Invariant 5: Prerequisite Transitivity
```
If test B depends on A, and test C depends on B:
  - C can declare prerequisite "B" (system checks B's prerequisites)
  - OR C can declare prerequisites "A", "B" (explicit chain)
  - Either way, when C runs, A and B are guaranteed complete
```

## Understanding Test Execution Flow

### Scenario 1: Clean Run (No Existing State)

```
User: test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/03-meta.bats

03-meta setup_file():
  ├─ setup_sequential_test("03-meta", "02-setup")
  ├─ load_test_env("sequential")
  │  └─ Environment doesn't exist, creates it
  ├─ detect_dirty_state("03-meta")
  │  └─ No state markers, returns 0 (clean)
  ├─ Check prerequisite "02-setup"
  │  └─ .complete-02-setup missing
  ├─ Run prerequisite: bats 02-setup.bats
  │  ├─ 02-setup setup_file()
  │  ├─ Check prerequisite "01-clone"
  │  │  └─ .complete-01-clone missing
  │  ├─ Run prerequisite: bats 01-clone.bats
  │  │  ├─ Creates TEST_REPO
  │  │  ├─ Marks complete
  │  │  └─ Returns success
  │  ├─ Runs setup.sh
  │  ├─ Marks complete
  │  └─ Returns success
  └─ mark_test_start("03-meta")

03-meta runs tests...

03-meta teardown_file():
  └─ mark_test_complete("03-meta")
```

### Scenario 2: Reusing Existing State

```
User: test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/03-meta.bats
(State from previous run exists: .complete-01-clone, .complete-02-setup)

03-meta setup_file():
  ├─ load_test_env("sequential")
  │  └─ Environment exists, loads it
  ├─ detect_dirty_state("03-meta")
  │  └─ No pollution detected, returns 0 (clean)
  ├─ Check prerequisite "02-setup"
  │  └─ .complete-02-setup exists, skip
  └─ mark_test_start("03-meta")

03-meta runs tests...
```

### Scenario 3: Pollution Detected

```
User: test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/02-setup.bats
(State from previous full run exists: .complete-01-clone through .complete-05-setup-final)

02-setup setup_file():
  ├─ load_test_env("sequential")
  ├─ detect_dirty_state("02-setup")
  │  ├─ Check test order: 01-clone, 02-setup, 03-meta, 04-dist, 05-setup-final
  │  ├─ Current test: 02-setup
  │  ├─ Tests after 02-setup: 03-meta, 04-dist, 05-setup-final
  │  ├─ Check: .start-03-meta exists? YES
  │  └─ POLLUTION DETECTED, return 1
  ├─ Environment polluted!
  ├─ clean_env("sequential")
  ├─ load_test_env("sequential")  # Recreates
  ├─ Run prerequisite: bats 01-clone.bats
  │  └─ Rebuilds from scratch
  └─ mark_test_start("02-setup")

02-setup runs tests with clean state...
```

## When to Use Sequential vs Independent

### Use Sequential Test When:
- Testing core pgxntool workflow steps
- Building on previous test's work
- State is expensive to create
- Tests naturally run in order

**Example**: Testing `make dist` (requires clone → setup → meta to work)

### Use Independent Test When:
- Testing a specific feature in isolation
- Feature can be tested from any starting point
- Want to avoid affecting sequential state
- Plan to run tests in parallel (future)

**Example**: Testing documentation generation (needs repo setup, but doesn't affect other tests)

### Signs You Chose Wrong:

**Sequential test that should be independent**:
- Test doesn't depend on previous test's work
- Other sequential tests don't depend on it
- Test is slow and could be parallelized

**Independent test that should be sequential**:
- Test needs exactly the same prerequisites as existing sequential tests
- Test is part of the core workflow
- Creating fresh environment is wasteful

## Testing Your Changes

### Minimum Test Matrix

Before committing changes to test system:

```bash
# 1. Clean full run
rm -rf .envs/
for test in tests-bats/0*.bats; do
  test/bats/bin/bats "$test" || exit 1
done

# 2. Rerun (should reuse state)
for test in tests-bats/0*.bats; do
  test/bats/bin/bats "$test" || exit 1
done

# 3. Partial rerun (should detect pollution)
rm -rf .envs/
test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/01-clone.bats
test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/02-setup.bats
test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/03-meta.bats
# Now run earlier test (should detect pollution)
test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/02-setup.bats

# 4. Individual test (should auto-run prerequisites)
rm -rf .envs/
test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/04-dist.bats
```

### Debug Checklist

When test fails:
1. [ ] Check state markers: `ls -la .envs/sequential/.bats-state/`
2. [ ] Check PID files: Any stale? Any actually running?
3. [ ] Check test environment: Does TEST_REPO exist? Contains expected files?
4. [ ] Run with debug: `DEBUG=5 test/bats/bin/bats tests-bats/XX-test.bats`
5. [ ] Check prerequisites: Do they pass individually?
6. [ ] Check git status: Is repo dirty? Any uncommitted changes?

## Common Questions

### Q: Why can't I just remove the pollution detection?

**A**: Without it, you get false results. Example:
- Run full suite (01-05), test 04 fails
- Fix test 04 code
- Rerun test 04 → passes!
- But you're testing against state from old test 03
- When you run full suite, test 04 might still fail

Pollution detection ensures you're always testing against correct state.

### Q: Why not just clean environment before every test?

**A**: Too slow. Running prerequisites for every test means:
- Test 02 runs: clone
- Test 03 runs: clone + setup
- Test 04 runs: clone + setup + meta
- Test 05 runs: clone + setup + meta + dist

Full suite would run clone ~15 times. With state sharing:
- Clone runs once
- Each test adds incremental work

### Q: Can I add helper functions to helpers.bash?

**A**: Yes, but:
- Add tests for new assertions
- Don't break existing functions
- Use clear names
- Add comments explaining purpose
- Test with full suite after adding

### Q: What if I want a test that doesn't fit either pattern?

**A**: Rare, but possible. Options:
1. Make it a standalone script in `tests/` (legacy system)
2. Make it independent test with custom setup
3. Rethink - maybe it's actually a variant of sequential or independent

### Q: Can sequential tests run in parallel?

**A**: No, they share state. Running in parallel would cause:
- Race conditions on state markers
- Conflicting changes to TEST_REPO
- Pollution detection false positives

Only independent tests can run in parallel (future feature).

## Summary: Key Principles

1. **Filename determines behavior**: `[0-9][0-9]-*.bats` = sequential rules apply
2. **Sequential = shared state**: All use `"sequential"` environment
3. **Independent = isolated state**: Each uses unique environment name
4. **Pollution detection protects correctness**: Don't disable it
5. **State markers are the source of truth**: `.start-*`, `.complete-*`, `.pid-*`
6. **Prerequisites must be explicit**: Don't rely on implicit ordering
7. **Always mark complete**: Even if tests fail, `teardown_file()` must run
8. **Test the tests**: Changes to helpers.bash affect entire suite

When in doubt, read the code in:
- `helpers.bash:detect_dirty_state()` - Pollution detection logic
- `helpers.bash:setup_sequential_test()` - Sequential test setup
- `01-clone.bats` - Simplest sequential test example
- `test-doc.bats` - Independent test example (when it exists)
