# commit

Create a git commit following all project standards and safety protocols for pgxntool-test.

**FIRST: Check BOTH repositories for changes**

**CRITICAL**: Before doing ANYTHING else, you MUST check git status in both repositories to understand the full scope of changes:

```bash
# Check pgxntool (main framework)
echo "=== pgxntool status ==="
cd ../pgxntool && git status

# Check pgxntool-test (test harness)
echo "=== pgxntool-test status ==="
cd ../pgxntool-test && git status
```

**Why this matters**: Work on pgxntool frequently involves changes across both repositories. You need to understand the complete picture before committing anywhere.

**IMPORTANT**: If BOTH repositories have changes, you should commit BOTH of them (unless the user explicitly says otherwise). This ensures related changes stay synchronized across the repos.

**DO NOT create empty commits** - Only commit repos that actually have changes (modified/untracked files). If a repo has no changes, skip it.

---

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Git Safety**: Never update `git config`, never force push to `main`/`master`, never skip hooks unless explicitly requested

2. **Commit Attribution**: Do NOT add "Generated with Claude Code" to commit message body. The standard Co-Authored-By trailer is acceptable per project CLAUDE.md.

3. **Testing**: ALL tests must pass before committing:
   - Run `make test`
   - Check the output carefully for any "not ok" lines
   - Count passing vs total tests
   - **If ANY tests fail: STOP. Do NOT commit. Ask the user what to do.**
   - There is NO such thing as an "acceptable" failing test
   - Do NOT rationalize failures as "pre-existing" or "unrelated"

**WORKFLOW:**

1. Run in parallel: `git status`, `git diff --stat`, `git log -10 --oneline`

2. Check test status - THIS IS MANDATORY:
   - Run `make test 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test-output.txt`
   - Check for failing tests: `grep "^not ok" /tmp/test-output.txt`
   - If ANY tests fail: STOP immediately and inform the user
   - Only proceed if ALL tests pass

3. Analyze changes in BOTH repositories and draft commit messages for BOTH:

   For pgxntool:
   - Analyze: `git status`, `git diff --stat`, `git log -10 --oneline`
   - Draft message with structure:
     ```
     Subject line

     [Main changes in pgxntool...]

     Related changes in pgxntool-test:
     - [RELEVANT test change 1]
     - [RELEVANT test change 2]

     Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
     ```
   - Only mention RELEVANT test changes (1-3 bullets):
     * ✅ Include: Tests for new features, template updates, user docs
     * ❌ Exclude: Test refactoring, infrastructure, internal changes
   - Wrap code references in backticks (e.g., `helpers.bash`, `make test`)
   - No hash placeholder needed - pgxntool doesn't reference test hash

   For pgxntool-test:
   - Analyze: `git status`, `git diff --stat`, `git log -10 --oneline`
   - Draft message with structure:
     ```
     Subject line

     Add tests/updates for pgxntool commit [PGXNTOOL_COMMIT_HASH] (brief description):
     - [Key pgxntool change 1]
     - [Key pgxntool change 2]

     [pgxntool-test specific changes...]

     Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
     ```
   - Use placeholder `[PGXNTOOL_COMMIT_HASH]`
   - Include brief summary (2-3 bullets) of pgxntool changes near top
   - Wrap code references in backticks

   **If only one repo has changes:**
   Skip the repo with no changes. In the commit message for the repo that has changes,
   add: "Changes only in [repo]. No related changes in [other repo]." before Co-Authored-By.

4. **PRESENT both proposed commit messages to the user and WAIT for approval**

   Show both messages:
   ```
   ## Proposed Commit for pgxntool:
   [message]

   ## Proposed Commit for pgxntool-test:
   [message with [PGXNTOOL_COMMIT_HASH] placeholder]
   ```

   **Note:** Mention any files that are intentionally not being committed and why.

   **Note:** If only one repo has changes, show only that message (with note about other repo).

5. **After receiving approval, execute two-phase commit:**

   **Phase 1: Commit pgxntool**

   a. `cd ../pgxntool`

   b. Stage changes: `git add` (include ALL new files per guidelines below)
      - Check `git status` for untracked files
      - ALL untracked files that are part of the feature/change MUST be staged
      - New scripts, new documentation, new helper files, etc. should all be included
      - Do NOT leave new files uncommitted unless explicitly told to exclude them

   c. Verify staged files: `git status`
      - Confirm ALL modified AND untracked files are staged
      - STOP and ask user if staging doesn't match intent

   d. Commit using approved message:
      ```bash
      git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
      [approved pgxntool message]
      EOF
      )"
      ```

   e. Capture hash: `PGXNTOOL_HASH=$(git log -1 --format=%h)`

   f. Verify: `git status`

   g. Handle pre-commit hooks if needed:
      - Check if hooks modified files
      - Check authorship: `git log -1 --format='%an %ae'`
      - Check branch status
      - Amend if safe or create new commit

   **Phase 2: Commit pgxntool-test**

   a. `cd ../pgxntool-test`

   b. Replace `[PGXNTOOL_COMMIT_HASH]` in approved message with `$PGXNTOOL_HASH`
      - Keep everything else EXACTLY the same

   c. Stage changes: `git add` (include ALL new files)

   d. Verify staged files: `git status`

   e. Commit using hash-injected message:
      ```bash
      git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
      [approved message with actual pgxntool hash]
      EOF
      )"
      ```

   f. Capture hash: `TEST_HASH=$(git log -1 --format=%h)`

   g. Verify: `git status`

   h. Handle pre-commit hooks if needed

   **Note:** If only one repo has changes, skip the phase for the other repo.

**MULTI-REPO COMMIT CONTEXT:**

**CRITICAL**: Work on pgxntool frequently involves changes across both repositories simultaneously:
- **pgxntool** (this repo) - The main framework
- **pgxntool-test** (at `../pgxntool-test/`) - Test harness (includes template files in `template/` directory)

**This is why you MUST check both repositories at the start** (see FIRST step above).

**DEFAULT BEHAVIOR: Commit ALL repos with changes together** - If both repos have changes when you check them, you should plan to commit BOTH repos (unless user explicitly specifies otherwise). This keeps related changes synchronized. **Do NOT create empty commits** - only commit repos with actual modified/untracked files.

When committing changes that span repositories:

1. **pgxntool-test commit MUST reference pgxntool commit hash**

   pgxntool commit format:
   ```
   Subject line

   [Main changes...]

   Related changes in pgxntool-test:
   - [RELEVANT test change]
   - [Keep to 1-3 bullets]

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```

   pgxntool-test commit format:
   ```
   Subject line

   Add tests for pgxntool commit def5678 (brief description):
   - [Key pgxntool change 1]
   - [Key pgxntool change 2]

   [pgxntool-test specific changes...]

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```

2. **Relevance filter for pgxntool message:**
   - ✅ Include: Tests for new features, template updates, user documentation
   - ❌ Exclude: Test refactoring, infrastructure changes, internal improvements
   - Keep it brief (1-3 bullets max)

3. **Commit workflow:**
   - Commit pgxntool first (no placeholder)
   - Capture pgxntool hash
   - Commit pgxntool-test (inject pgxntool hash)
   - Result: pgxntool-test references pgxntool commit

4. **Single-repo case:**
   Add line: "Changes only in [repo]. No related changes in [other repo]."

**REPOSITORY CONTEXT:**

This is pgxntool, a PostgreSQL extension build framework. Key facts:
- Main Makefile is `base.mk`
- Scripts live in root directory
- Documentation is in `README.asc` (generates `README.html`)

**RESTRICTIONS:**
- DO NOT push unless explicitly asked
- DO NOT commit files with actual secrets (`.env`, `credentials.json`, etc.)
- Never use `-i` flags (`git commit -i`, `git rebase -i`, etc.)
