# CI Monitor Skill

Monitor GitHub Actions CI across both repos after a push. Always run in background.

## Usage

- `/ci` — monitor the most recent CI run on both repos for the current branch
- `/ci pgxntool-test` — monitor pgxntool-test only
- `/ci pgxntool` — monitor pgxntool only
- `/ci both <branch> <pgxntool-test-sha> <pgxntool-sha>` — monitor specific push SHAs (most reliable)

## Workflow

### 1. Start Monitor (Background)

After every `git push`, immediately launch:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/ci/scripts/monitor-ci.sh [repos] [branch] [sha1] [sha2]
```

Arguments:
- `repos`: `both` (default), `pgxntool-test`, or `pgxntool`
- `branch`: the branch just pushed (default: current git branch)
- `sha1`: SHA pushed to pgxntool-test (optional but recommended)
- `sha2`: SHA pushed to pgxntool (optional but recommended)

When pushing to both repos, always pass the SHAs to avoid a race condition where
`--branch` might pick up a different concurrent push on the same branch.

> **Race condition note**: `gh run list --branch` returns the most recent run on
> that branch — if two pushes happen close together (e.g. two sessions pushing
> in parallel), it may pick up the wrong run. Passing the `sha1`/`sha2`
> positional arguments above lets the script resolve the run via `gh run list
> --commit` internally, targeting the exact push and avoiding this — the
> script itself has no `--commit` flag. When SHA is unavailable, always verify
> the `=== BRANCHES: ===` line in the output matches the code you pushed.

**Always use `run_in_background: true`.**

### 2. Read Results

When the background task completes, read the output. The script discovers
**every** workflow run GitHub triggers for the pushed commit — currently the
real test matrix (`CI`) and an automated reviewer (`Claude Code Review`) in
each repo — and waits for and reports on all of them, rather than assuming
there's exactly one relevant run and taking whichever one comes back first
(that ambiguity used to let it silently latch onto the wrong run — see
"Known pitfalls" below).

This is default-include: if a new workflow starts firing on pushes in the
future, the script picks it up and gates on it automatically, no code change
needed. `EXCLUDE_WORKFLOWS` near the top of `monitor-ci.sh` is the escape
hatch for a workflow that fires on a push but should never gate this check
(empty by default). The script emits:

```text
[pgxntool-test] Run 12345678 (CI) found
[pgxntool-test] Run 12345679 (Claude Code Review) found
[pgxntool-test] === BRANCHES: pgxntool-test=feature/foo pgxntool=feature/foo ===
[pgxntool-test] Polling... (still running: CI, Claude Code Review)
[pgxntool-test] Run 12345678 (CI) completed: SUCCESS
[pgxntool-test] PASS  🐘 PostgreSQL 12
[pgxntool-test] PASS  🐘 PostgreSQL 15
[pgxntool-test] FAIL  🐘 PostgreSQL 13
[pgxntool-test] === FAILURE (CI): 🐘 PostgreSQL 13 ===
... failure log lines ...
[pgxntool-test] Run 12345679 (Claude Code Review) completed: SKIPPED
[pgxntool-test] SKIPPED  claude-review
OVERALL: FAIL
```

The **last line is always `OVERALL: <STATUS>`**. Check this first:

| OVERALL | Exit code | Meaning |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `ALL_PASS` | 0 | Every discovered run succeeded (or legitimately skipped) — safe to proceed |
| `FAIL` | 1 | One or more runs failed — stop and report |
| `TIMEOUT` | 2 | Run(s) did not complete within timeout |
| `NO_RUNS` | 3 | No (non-excluded) workflow run was found for this branch/SHA after waiting |

A `Claude Code Review` run concluding `SKIPPED` is normal, not a failure — it
no-ops on draft PRs and on PRs from untrusted forks (see
`claude-code-review.yml`'s job-level `if:`). Only `FAILURE`/`CANCELLED`/etc.
count against `OVERALL`.

**Always verify the `=== BRANCHES ===` line** matches the code you just pushed —
this is your primary safeguard against the `--branch` race condition. If the
branches don't match, cancel the run and re-trigger: `gh run cancel <id> --repo
<repo>` then re-push or re-run via `gh run rerun`.

### 3. Enforce Results

**CRITICAL RULES:**

1. Any CI failure must be **reported to the user immediately**. Do not continue with other work.
2. Start diagnosis from the **first** `not ok` line to understand the root cause, but do not assume later failures are cascading or caused by it — treat each failure as likely real and needing its own investigation. Failures in separate test files are typically unrelated; even multiple failures within the same file may be independent.
3. Failures in our workflow files (dependency installs, git config, etc.) are our problem to fix.
4. Failures in test code (not ok from BATS) may be pre-existing — report to user and ask before touching test files.
5. Never rationalize failures as "pre-existing" or "unrelated" without explicitly telling the user.
6. If CI is taking longer than expected on pgxntool, it may be waiting up to 20 min for pgxntool-test CI to complete — that is normal.

## Key rules

1. **ALWAYS** monitor CI after every push — use this skill, never `gh run watch` directly
2. When pushing to both repos, start two background monitors simultaneously (one per repo)
3. Pass the exact push SHA when available — `--branch` has a race condition on rapid pushes
4. The `=== BRANCHES ===` line in the output confirms which code is under test — always verify it matches your intent
5. A PR is only green once **every** workflow run triggered for that SHA has completed — don't treat `OVERALL: ALL_PASS` from an old, partial run as sufficient

## Known pitfalls

`gh run list --commit SHA` with no filter returns every workflow run tied to
that commit, in an order that isn't guaranteed to put the real CI run first.
Since `CI` (event `pull_request`) and `Claude Code Review` (event
`pull_request_target`) both trigger on the same push, taking `.[0]` of that
unfiltered list used to be able to silently grab the review run and report
on it as if it were the test matrix — the `=== BRANCHES ===` line would then
never appear at all, because only `CI`'s jobs emit it. The script avoids this
by discovering the full set of runs tied to the commit (settling briefly so
sibling runs GitHub hasn't indexed yet are caught) and monitoring all of them
to completion, rather than assuming there is exactly one relevant run.

`gh run list --jq` only accepts a plain jq expression string — it does not
pass through extra jq flags like `--argjson`. Passing `--argjson` to `gh run
list` itself fails with "unknown command", so the exclude-list filter is
applied by piping `gh`'s raw `--json` output into a separate real `jq`
invocation instead.
