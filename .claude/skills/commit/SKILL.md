# Commit Skill

Create git commits following project standards and safety protocols for pgxntool-test.

## Critical Requirements

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Git Safety** | Never update git config. Never force push. Never skip hooks unless requested. |
| **Attribution** | No "Generated with Claude Code" in body. Co-Authored-By trailer is OK. |
| **Multi-Repo** | Commit BOTH repos if both have changes (unless told otherwise). No empty commits. |
| **Testing** | ALL tests must pass. ANY failure = STOP and ask user. No rationalizing failures. |
| **HISTORY.asc** | Update for significant user-visible pgxntool changes. Propose entry, get confirmation. |

## Workflow

### 1. Launch Tests (Background)

Use Task tool to launch test subagent to run `make test` in background.
Skip only if user explicitly says to.

### 2. Gather Repository Info

Run the preprocessing script to collect all git data in one call:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/commit/scripts/gather-repo-info.sh ../pgxntool .
```

Review output. Identify which repos have changes.

### 3. Check HISTORY.asc (pgxntool changes only)

Read `../pgxntool/HISTORY.asc`. Determine if changes are significant and user-visible:
- Yes: New features, behavior changes, bug fixes users would notice
- No: Internal refactoring, test changes, cleanup, documentation fixes

If update needed:
1. Propose entry in AsciiDoc format (use `==` for heading)
2. Ask for confirmation BEFORE proceeding
3. Add to STABLE section at TOP of file (create section if missing):
   ```
   STABLE
   ------
   == [Entry heading]
   [Entry description]

   [existing content...]
   ```

### 4. Draft Commit Messages

Read the format guide for detailed templates and rules:
**`.claude/skills/commit/guides/commit-message-format.md`**

Key principles:
- Order items by **decreasing importance** (impact x likelihood someone cares)
- pgxntool message includes relevant test changes (1-3 bullets)
- pgxntool-test message uses `[PGXNTOOL_COMMIT_HASH]` placeholder
- Single-repo: note "Changes only in [repo]. No related changes in [other repo]."
- Wrap code references in backticks

### 5. Present for Approval

Show proposed commit messages. Wait for user approval.
Mention any files intentionally excluded and why.
If only one repo has changes, show only that message (with note about other repo).

### 6. Verify Tests Passed (MANDATORY)

Check test subagent output for completion.
- Look for ANY "not ok" lines
- **If tests fail: STOP. Do NOT commit. Ask user what to do.**
- There is NO such thing as an "acceptable" failing test
- Do NOT rationalize failures as "pre-existing" or "unrelated"
- Only proceed if ALL tests pass

### 7. Execute Two-Phase Commit

After tests pass AND receiving user approval:

1. **Phase 1: Commit pgxntool** (if it has changes)
   - Stage files: `git add` specific files (include ALL new files for the feature)
   - Verify staging: `git status` (STOP if mismatch)
   - Commit with approved message using HEREDOC
   - Capture hash: `PGXNTOOL_HASH=$(git log -1 --format=%h)`
   - Verify: `git status`

2. **Phase 2: Commit pgxntool-test** (if it has changes)
   - Replace `[PGXNTOOL_COMMIT_HASH]` with captured hash
   - Stage, verify, commit, verify (same pattern)

For detailed execution steps including pre-commit hook handling, read:
**`.claude/skills/commit/guides/commit-message-format.md`** -> "Two-Phase Commit Execution"

Always use HEREDOC format:
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[message]
EOF
)"
```

## Restrictions

- DO NOT push unless explicitly asked
- DO NOT commit files with secrets (.env, credentials.json)
- Never use `-i` flags (git commit -i, git rebase -i)
