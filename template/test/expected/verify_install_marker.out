-- Verify test/install state persists into the main test suite

-- DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE WITHOUT EXPLICIT HUMAN APPROVAL.
--
-- This test exists to catch a specific, subtle bug: if test/install and the
-- main test suite run in separate pg_regress invocations, pg_regress drops
-- and recreates the database between them, destroying everything test/install
-- set up. The ONLY way test/install state can persist is if install files and
-- regular test files run within a SINGLE pg_regress invocation (via a schedule
-- file that lists install files first).
--
-- If this test fails with "relation pgxntool_install_marker does not exist",
-- it means the test-install implementation is broken: it's running install
-- files in a separate pg_regress invocation instead of the same one.
--
-- This file is intentionally minimal to prevent well-meaning "improvements"
-- from masking the failure it's designed to detect.
