# Test: inventory of the make variables pgxntool defines
#
# Fails whenever pgxntool's *.mk files define a variable that
# test/lib/pgxntool-variables.txt doesn't classify, or stop defining one it
# lists, so every new variable gets a deliberate api/internal/legacy/external
# decision. Needs pg_config (for PGXS) but no foundation env or Postgres.
#
# The list comes from make's own database (`make -p`), keeping each variable
# whose origin line ("# makefile (from 'pgxntool/<file>.mk', ...)", or
# "# 'override' directive (from ...)") points into pgxntool. That origin is
# the variable's *last* assignment, so a variable
# pgxntool sets but PGXS later appends to (REGRESS_OPTS) shows up as PGXS's and
# isn't listed. Variables that only ever arrive on a sub-make command line
# (_PGXNTOOL_TEST_BUILD_ACTIVE) don't appear either.
#
# Variables generated into the extension's meta.mk/control.mk (PGXN,
# PGXNVERSION, EXTENSION_*) are deliberately out of scope: those files live
# outside pgxntool/, so the origin filter drops them. Whether they need their
# own naming rule is a separate question.
