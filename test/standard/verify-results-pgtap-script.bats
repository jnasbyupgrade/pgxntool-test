# Test: verify-results-pgtap.sh - pure script-logic unit tests
#
# These tests exercise pgxntool's verify-results-pgtap.sh directly against a
# bare scratch directory -- no foundation environment, no `make`, no
# PostgreSQL. They own all of the script's decision logic: which pgtap output
# in results/*.out counts as a failure, and which regression.diffs entries
# block `make results` (a real mismatch against an existing baseline) versus
# which are a brand-new test that has no expected output yet (issue #119).
#
# Tests that need real Make/PostgreSQL integration stay in make-test.bats:
# that `make verify-results` invokes this script and propagates its exit
# status, and that a real pg_regress run against base.mk's empty
# expected-file placeholder actually produces the "@@ -0,0" diff shape the
# classification below keys on.
