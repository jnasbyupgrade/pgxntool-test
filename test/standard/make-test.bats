# Test: make test / make results / verify-results
#
# These three targets are one tightly-coupled pipeline -- `make results` and
# `make verify-results` only exist to safely update the expected output that
# `make test` checks against -- so they share a single file and a single
# foundation-copied environment rather than three. Covers:
# - `make test` succeeds against the template's known-good state
# - EXTRA_CLEAN targets the real $(TESTOUT)/results/ directory (issue #7)
# - unique per-directory database naming (REGRESS_DBNAME)
# - installcheck always runs after install, even when pulled in indirectly
#   (issue #79)
# - PGXNTOOL_ENABLE_FS_INSTALL can disable the install prerequisite entirely,
#   for "existing mode"/pg_tle-style testing (issues #55, #90)
# - PGXNTOOL_ENABLE_PGXN_INSTALL can independently disable the pgtap
#   dependency's own `pgxn install --sudo` auto-install
# - _check-stale-expected catches orphaned test/expected/*.out files (issue #14)
# - `make test` exits non-zero on a real regression.diffs mismatch (issue #49)
# - verify-results blocks `make results` when tests are failing, lets a
#   brand-new test's first expected output through (issue #119), and can be
#   disabled. Its own pass/fail logic lives in verify-results-pgtap-script.bats
# - PGXNTOOL_VERIFY_RESULTS_MODE is validated (pgtap/diffs, case-insensitive)
